Python Serial Grapher for Debugging Visualisation

Requires PyQt4, pyqtgraph, pyopengl, and python 3.x

Current features:
 - Select which variables you wish to plot from list/legend
 - Separation of plot data from user readable data using '$'

Performance is much better than serialGraph (an older but more lightweight app I made for similar purposes).
